## Dictionaries one may use
This directory contains various plaintext dictionaries one may use to find a Sator Square.

If your dictionary is too small, no set of words may be found that satisfies all the criteria for a Sator Square.  If the dictionary is large, your chances are better, but at the risk of including really arcane words (especially in English).

Files are zipped to save space.  Unzip for use with the program.

- **English3.zip** = a large English dictionary.
- **la-novs-nodups.zip** = The plaintext Latin dictionary generated procedurally from the Hunspell Latin dictionary that I modified as described in the main Readme.  The filename is short for Latin, no Vs, no duplicate words.

The repo of Titus Wormer [has lots of Hunspell dictionaries](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries/tree/main/dictionaries) which may be similarly modified.
